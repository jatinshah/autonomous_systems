Software that you need to install for FVision to work:

a) Frp (need an account on haskell.org)

cvs -d haskell.org:/home/cvs co frp 

b) FVision (need the cips account)

cvs -d cips@peregrine.cs.jhu.edu:/users/rtfm7/cips/repository co FVision

c) Hugs.  Probably NOT the Feb 01 release!  Make sure Hugs is linked with g++: either 
   change LD to g++ in the Makefile or override it when calling make

d) XVision2 (need the xvis account)

cvs -d xvis@pong.cs.jhu.edu:/home/xvis/repository co XVision2

e) Green card.  Install off the rpm accessable from haskell.org - you'll need this to
   compile.

f) SOE Graphics.  There is a tar file with everything available at 
  http://haskell.org/NewSOEGraphics.tar

You need to set the Hugs search path to include FVision, frp/src, and SOEGraphics

Hugs must use a pre-processor to load this version of the graphics library.  The option is 
  --F"$GRAPHICS_DIR/hscpp -d__HUGS__"
where GRAPHICS_DIR is the SOE graphics directory (make sure you see hscpp there).

Building: the Makefile in FVision needs to be changed to give it the path to XVision2.  You need
to make XVision2 and run make in FVision.

Testing: there are some tests in FVTests you can run to see whether the system works.
